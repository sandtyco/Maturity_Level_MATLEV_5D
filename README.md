Application of Information Technology Maturity Level Measurement in Digitalization of Learning

The MATLEV 5D application is an innovative tool designed to measure the level of maturity and effectiveness of digital learning. The MATLEV 5D assessment focuses on three main aspects, namely Methods, Materials, and Media or called (3M) which are evaluated and classified into five dimensions of maturity levels, namely, Traditional, Enhanced, Mobile, Ubiquitous, and Smart or abbreviated (TEMUS). The assessment is based on multiple perspectives, namely from the value of the Course RPS aspect, Lecturer Learning Style, and Student Learning Experience, providing a comprehensive picture of the effectiveness of Digitalization in Learning. MATLEV 5D will help institutions to know the extent to which digitalization practices in learning are running.

MATLEV 5D stands for Maturity Level 5 Dimensions, a systematic measurement framework for evaluating the effectiveness and maturity of digital learning. This application assesses students based on three Key Aspects (3M):
1. Methods: How digital teaching approaches are implemented.
2. Materials: The quality and format of digital learning materials used.
3. Media: The utilization of technological platforms and tools in learning delivery.

The measurement results for these three aspects are then classified into five Dimensions of Digitalization Maturity (5D):
1. Traditional: Learning is still predominantly conventional with minimal digital influences.
2. Enhanced: The use of technology is being introduced to increase the efficiency of the learning process.
3. Mobile: Learning is supported by accessibility through mobile devices, allowing location flexibility.
4. Ubiquitous: Learning can be accessed anytime and anywhere, integrated with the digital environment.
5. Smart: Personalized and adaptive learning, utilizing data analytics and artificial intelligence.

Assessment in MATLEV 5D is also multi-perspective, collecting data from various perspectives for a holistic picture:
1. Course Plan: Evaluation based on planning and syllabus.
2. Lecturer: Assessment from the perspective of the implementing instructor.
3. Student: Feedback from the students' direct experiences.
Thus, MATLEV 5D provides an in-depth and objective overview of the state of digital learning, enabling you to make strategic decisions for future improvement.

MATLEV 5D is equipped with various features designed to facilitate your evaluation and analysis:
1. Comprehensive 3M Assessment: A structured assessment tool that includes Learning Methods, Materials, and Media.
2. 5D Maturity Classification: Automated classification of digitalization levels into Traditional, Enhanced, Mobile, Ubiquitous, and Smart dimensions.
3. Multi-Perspective Data Input: Supports input from Admins, Lecturers, and Students for accurate and balanced results.
4. Intuitive User Interface: Dedicated pages for Admins, Lecturers, and Students with role-specific functions.
5. Reports & Results Visualization: (If existing/to be developed) Presents assessment results in easy-to-understand reports and graphs.
6. User & Course Data Management: Admins can efficiently manage user and course data.
